# Cloud :- gives you access to virtual machine where you can run your server. 
            We can't use local server worldwide, because of local machines don't have public IP
            So, EC2 gives you public Ip

            imp note:-
            Public IP always changes on stop and start ec2 server
            to avoid that use elastic IP 

# EC2 servers
    EC2 stands for Elastic compute version 2
    1) Elastic:- Can increase/decrease size of machine
    2) compute:- it's a machine


# USE CASES
1) rent server: EC2 server
    steps:-
        1. give name to your application
        2. select machine type eg. Ubuntu, Windows, MacOs, linux etc.
        3. Select type of instance eg. Micro ( have less pricing) -> small -> 2xl etc.
            pricing will increase based on type of instance
        4. Create new key pair 
            It gives you remotely access to AWS instance through aws CLI
            it will download .pem file which used in assess of aws instance

        # Security groups section
        SSH:- secure shell protocol through you can assess virtual machine

        by default PORTS of http and https
        1) http:- 80 ( you can access application through http://632.342.3.4) it assumes port listen at PORT 80
            that why we change PORT of server eg. if we listen on 3000 - you can assess through http://632.342.3.4:300
        2) https:- 443

        once instance in running state it will give you public Ip and public IPv4 dns  

        5. Click on launch instance:- it will launch the instance on AWS cloud

        don't forget to stop instance when not in use, otherwise it will increase cost/ bill of instance.
        select instance and click on stop instance option.

        connect to aws instance remotely:-
        1) go to .pem file location 
        2) run command:- ssh -i .\harkirat-class-password.pem windows@<publicIP>

        If you gets permission denied error run command
        chmod 700 <.pem file location> 
        700 convert in binary eg. -rwx------@ rwx === 111 in binary and rest of ----- === 00
        used to restrict access an give access.

        terminal commands
        1) exit --> to exit from instance
        2) git clone https://<repo address>
        3) ask for username and password
            type username 
            and for password generate  personal token form developer setting in github settings
        after that CLI will get git access

        # if don't have internet access
        run command vi /etc/resolv.conf file
        and insert 
        nameserver 8.8.8.8 
        and save file and exit

        install nodejs in ec2 instance
        with Installing Node Using the Node Version Manager
        curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh
        this will show script present into it

        curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
        this will run script and install nvm on ec2

        install nvm --> nvm install <version>

        to open any PORT in ec2
        add it into inbound port list

        steps:
        1. Click on security 
        2. click on your security group in
        3. click on edit inbound rules
        4. click on add rule
        5. select custom tcp ---> give PORT --> select anywere from IPV4
        6. select custom tcp ---> give PORT --> select anywere from IPV6

        to access server 
        type public IP with port in address bar eg. 13.201.94.183:8080 --> where you access your deployed remote server
