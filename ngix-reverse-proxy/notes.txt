# reverse proxy
    1. proxy:- listening a service and forwarding to final service  
    1. reverse proxy is used to map/route multiple ec2 server on PORT 80
    intercept and inspect incoming client requests before forwarding them.


    # install nginx
    commands:-
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install nginx

    after Installing nginx in ec2 --> ec2 will automatically runs at nginx PORT 80

    Commands
    #Create reverse proxy
    sudo rm sudo vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf ---> remove resolv.conf
    sudo vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf ---> edit resolv.conf --> This file contains nginx configuration

    http {
        server {
            listen 80;
            server_name be1.100xdevs.com; --> Domain ( required for use nginx routing)

            location / {
                proxy_pass http://localhost:8080; --> your server URL with PORT running in ec2 . ie --> localhost of ec2 env 
                proxy_http_version 1.1;
                proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
                proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
                proxy_set_header Host $host;
                proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
            }
        }
    }

    Above code is responsible for Routing of different server on PORT 80 

    sudo nginx -s reload ---> reload nginx server

    IMP:-
    go to your domain console -->
    add subDomain( DNS ) which you have pointed in nginx --->
    select  Type --> a
    add your ec2 instance public IP field

    in this way this subdomain will access your ec2 server through nginx routing


    # Host any domain on your local machine IP
    run command 
        sudo vi /etc/host
        add and entry of your IP with that domain name
